I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Preventive Medicine from Peking University of China, Beijing in 2021. I graduated with a Master’s degree in Epidemiology & Biostatistics from the School of Public Health, Peking University in 2023, advised by [Dr. Xun Tang](https://sph.pku.edu.cn/info/1181/3599.htm). I am now a fourth-year Ph.D student in Emergency Health Management at Peking University, fortunate to work with [Dr. Li Yang](https://sph.pku.edu.cn/info/1533/4282.htm).
